emotions:

first entry it completely focuses on the anxiety which is essentially fear, but forgets about the happy part of it. The nlp needs to section the entry because time is apart of understanding the emotions
second: I feel like it should be more neutral
fifth: wrong, should be mostly happy
eleventh: wrong, should be joy

for the majority of these things, it appears to be working on buzz words rather than actaul emotions conveyed through tone, needs refinement.



summary:

absolutely sucks
it basically just copies the text given. I defineatly would need to finetune it so that it understands what we are looking for. It probably wouldnt be difficult to do since I could easily just use 4o with a query that would work perfectly. Need some query instructions or fine tuning.
