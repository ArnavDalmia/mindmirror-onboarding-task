Emotion, task 1:

selected the most popular emotional classification model on the hugging face hub

The model is a fine-tuned checkpoint of DistilRoBERTa-base, a lightweight nlp

we get the 6 basic emotions: (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness and surprise)
and in addition we also get the neutral emotion for ambiguous comments

its trained on 6 distinguished datasets that include sources for all emotions recognized.

One thing that would be good to add would be the emotions of "stress", "anxiety" and other common ones that would be found in journal entries.
